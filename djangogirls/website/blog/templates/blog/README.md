Post_list.html was my first HTML file of the tutorial. It was where I first displayed text wihtin my URL
However, this file is now template extended so that I can be used for other pages of my blog 
Base.html now holds all the previous information my post_list.html held 
Both files display block text as this creates a block on the page to insert the HTML files
Instead of adding all the text manually via these HTML files it connects the posts via admin to the interface of my blog automatically
