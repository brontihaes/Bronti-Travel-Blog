This file contains all the aesthetics of the blog
Using bootstrap I edited my page to different fonts and colours
I changed the padding of the text on the page so that the text is added away from the margin
I found HTML colour options via the internet and added my own light blue affect to the file.
I also installed the font Lobster for the title and any blog post titles
